I need to create the logic to handle the granularity. 
For this I need to create the apropiate routes to do that-

I need to change "seriesData" in the "HandlingOverviewModal" (comp_handling_overview_modal.tsx).

The key for this is to change how the information is retrieve from the database. 

Keys: 
- All the analysis must be made on the server side, otherwise, the application will have the same performance problems 
  it had in the past. 
- I need to ask what is better: 
  1) Request all the information once the user opens the modal 
  2) Request the information as needed. 

How these scenarios could work: 
-------------------------------------------------------
1) Requesting the whole information
The data will be stored in an object such as: 
data = {
    hourlyData,
    dailyData,
    weeklyData,
    monthlyData,
    YearlyData, 
}

The "DateRangeButtonChart" buttons will only select the information that is displayed. 
-------------------------------------------------------
2) Requesting the information as needed. 
- This will imply to create the necessary routes in the backend to ask for the information in 
  hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly format.

- The routes that will be used for this purpose need to accept the start date and end date

First task: 
Create the routes for the time granularity selectors.
