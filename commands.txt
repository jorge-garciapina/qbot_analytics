I WANT YOU TO IMPROVE THIS PROMPT: 
HERE IS THE CONTEXT FOR THE PROMPT YOU HAVE TO IMPROVE: 
1) IT WILL BE USED IN THE SAME CHAT THAT WAS USED TO CREATE THE TABLES AND CHARTS DISPLAYED ON THE IMAGE 1, 
   SO THE INFORMATION IS IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT CONVERSATION.  
2) IMAGE 1 DISPLAYS THE DAILY DATA, BUT AS THE CHAT CAN VERIFY, WE ALSO HAVE THE MONTHLY AND WEEKLY TABLES AND CHARTS. 
3) ON IMAGE 2 WE DISPLAY THE MONTHLY CHART AND THE DATA FILTER MENU THAT WILL ALLOW USERS TO SELECT THE DESIRED CONFIGURATION 
   TO DISPLAY THE DATA: BY SELECTING DAILY, THE CHART WILL BE REPLACED FOR THE DAILY CHART, AND THE SAME FOR THE WEEKLY. 

THE TASK I WANT TO EXECUTE IS THIS: 
USING THE PROVIDED CONTEXT, CREATE A PROMPT THAT WILL INDICATE THE CHATGPT OF THE OTHER CONVERSATION TO: 

THE TIME RANGE WILL DEPEND UPON THE GRANULARITY SELECTOR. FOR EXAMPLE, IF GRANULARITY IS DAILY, THEN IT SHOULD ALLOW 
TO CHOSE DAYS IN CALENDAR, IF GRANULARITY IS MONTHLY IT WILL ALLOW TO USE THE MONTHS OF A PARTICULAR YEAR. 

CREATE A PROMPT TO REQUEST FOR IDEAS FOR THE DATE RANGE DESIGN. 
EXPLAIN THE CONTEXT WITH CARE. USE THE IMAGES FOR REFERENCE, I WILL ATTACH THE SAME IMAGES WHEN I SEND THE PORMPT YOU WILL CREATE
